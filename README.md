# Infrastructure Automation Framework

## Overview
This project simulates a DevOps framework for automating infrastructure provisioning, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring. It includes infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform and Ansible, containerized deployments, CI/CD configurations, and monitoring solutions.

## Structure
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform and Ansible configurations for automated infrastructure.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions pipeline configurations.
- **Docker**: Dockerfiles and Docker Compose for containerized applications.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.
- **Logs**: Fluentd for centralized logging.

## Setup
1. Deploy infrastructure using `terraform` and `ansible`.
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines using configurations in `ci_cd/`.
3. Use `docker-compose` to build and run the application.
4. Monitor with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
